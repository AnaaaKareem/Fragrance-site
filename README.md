# How to run a website using http-server

This repository contains the source code for a simple website that can be run using http-server, a command-line tool that creates a local web server.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## How to run the website

To run the website, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal in your codespace. You can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette, and then type "toggle terminal" and press Enter to select.
2. Type `npm i -g http-server` in the terminal. This will install the http-server tool globally on your machine.
3. Type `http-server` in the same terminal. This will start the web server on a default port (usually 8080).
4. When the web server starts, you will see a pop-up message to let you know that the port has been forwarded. Click **Open in Browser** to view your website in a new tab.
5. If your `index.html` file is at the root of your project, it will be opened by default. Otherwise, you will need to write the correct path in the URL bar.
